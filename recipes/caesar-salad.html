      The Greek yogurt dressing is versatile and can be used as a dipping sauce
      on a vegetable platter. Double or triple the recipe to have this healthy
      dressing handy for an anytime salad treat.
      <br />
      Caesar salad made have Italian origins, but when we work a little fusion
      magic we can create an unbelievably creamy Caesar using plain Greek
      yogurt. The truth is that Caesar salad is not from Italy, but it is
      generally attributed to an Italian immigrant and is usually made with
      Romaine lettuce, croutons, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, lemon juice,
      anchovies or Worcestershire, garlic, black pepper and an egg yolk. An
      average Caesar salad will have almost 200 calories and 15 grams of fat.
      That is why we created this lower fat, egg free alternative that is extra
      creamy and the secret is the Greek yogurt.
      <br />
      Greek yogurt provides a great substitute for heavy cream and sour cream.
      In this case it works to keep the fat down and also allows us to keep this
      Caesar salad eggless. This salad has only 100 calories and 2 grams of fat,
      add some canned or grilled tuna and make it a full meal. And since we are
      already going fusion crazy, there is no need to stop at romaine and
      croutons with this salad dressing. Go ahead and make extra and use on all
      your favorite salads. If you leave it a little thicker you can even use it
      as a spread for a sandwich.
