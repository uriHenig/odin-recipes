    <p>
      Kishke is a traditional Jewish Ashkenazi food most often cooked inside the
      Shabbos cholent (stew), especially for those who have Polish ancestors.
      <br />
      The main ingredients are matzo meal, fat and spices, but there are many
      ways to make your own kishke with different fats or spices and even
      vegetables. This recipe gives you lots of options even a way to keep it
      vegetarian and comes together easily with your food processor.
